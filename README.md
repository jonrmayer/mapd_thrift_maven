# mapd_thrift_maven

This project generates the mapd thrift client in java and is part of an attempt to create Apache Nifi services/processors for MapD Data ingest

This is geared towards Windows and you will have to download the Thrift exe from the official site.

You will also have to edit the pom file for the location of this .exe.

Thrift files are located under resources and are pulled from mapd v 4.1.0
